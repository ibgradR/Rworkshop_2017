# Integrative Biology R Workshop 2017

Welcome to the IB Grad Students R workshop 2017!

**Date:** 14 - 16th Jan 2017

**Time:** 9am - 5pm 

**Venue:** VLSB (room TBD) 

The purpose of this student-organized workshop is to introduce and familiarize graduate students with little or no prior programming to the basics of R (and act as a stepping stone to greater proficiency).

If you are interested in attending, please let Jun Ying Lim (junyinglim.at.berkeley.edu) or Lucy Chang (luchang.at.berkeley.edu) know!

Last but not least, we really hope to see this workshop become a regular event in the academic calendar. If you are interested in volunteering in future years, please contact us.

## Logistics
Prior to coming to the workshop, you should install the latest (or at least a fairly recent) version of R (available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)) **and** RStudio (available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)). RStudio is a immensely popular graphical user interface for R that has many additional features.
